# 🏭 AI-Enhanced Hourly Sheet Tracking System

**Live Demo:** [neuralnomads.vercel.app](https://neuralnomads.vercel.app/)

This is a full-stack AI-powered system to enhance real-time monitoring on the factory floor through smart production tracking, anomaly detection, and predictive maintenance.

---

## 📦 Project Overview

**Hourly Sheet** logs are digitized and enhanced with AI for:
- Conversational insights via a chatbot
- Predictive analytics for downtime
- Anomaly detection in operator/machine performance

---

## 💡 Key Features

### 🧠 Conversational AI Assistant
- Ask questions like:
  - “How many units did Operator Y produce last shift?”
  - “Show today’s total defects by machine X.”
  - “Predict downtime risk for Machine Z.”

### 🔧 Downtime Prediction
- Predict machine breakdowns using historical logs and usage patterns.

### 🚨 Anomaly Detection
- Detect unusual patterns in production, such as sudden efficiency drops.
